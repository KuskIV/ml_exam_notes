# 05 - Markow Networks

In this lecture the focus will be on the topic of node classification in networks, with a focus on progabilistic classification using Markov Networks.

## Inductive vs Transductive

__Transductive__: The graph is fixed and the is the same when learning and predicting. All nodes needed to be lassified are already known when learning the classifier.

__Inductive__: The graph used for training, can be differen. Nodes that are classified can be new nodes added to the graph, or even be nodes in a different graph.

## Homophily

Homophily is when a link between individuals (such as friendshp or other social connection) is correlated with those individuals being similar in nature. For example, friends often tend to be similar in characteristics like age, social background and education leve.

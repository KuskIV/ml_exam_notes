- Neural network basics
- Loss functions
- Learning neural networks (gradient decent and stochastic gradient descent)
- Neural network structures

Hi im going to talk about the basics of a neural network.
The basic structure of a neural network contains the input layer and the output layer. In between these layers are the hidden layers and the activation functions.

Hello, i'm going to talk about **community detection**.

First of all what is a **community**?
A community in the graph context a part of the graph which is more **closely tied together internally** than they are with the rest of the graph. So communities are essentially a part of the network that **interacts more frequently** with each other.

In this context it is also important to know about **modularity**. **Modularity** is essentially a measure of how well the graph is connected, measuring the density of the connections withing a community. A high modularity score will have many connections within the community, but only a few connections outside the community.

In the first task we use the **Girvan-Newman algorthm** to find the **communities** in a **network**.
The **girvan Newman algorithm** is a method to find these communities in a network. It works by first calculating the edge betweenes score for each edge in the network. The edge betweenness is the amount of shortest paths passing through the edge. Then it findes the one with the highest score and removes it. If there is a tie, one is choosen at random. Now the edge betweenness is recalculated and the steps are repeated. This is repeated until the network is empty. This can then be used to select the best community's using the modularity score.

Here we see the modularity scores for the communites defineed by the Girvan-Newman algorithm 
k = 2: 0.0049
k = 3: 0.0049
k = 4: 0.071
k = 5: 0.073

They are all pretty bad. Which is shownn by computing the modularity score from the predined attributes, where we see that status and office have the highest score of 
Status          | k = 2: 0.255
Office          | k = 3: 0.197


We can also see that they suggest 2 and 3 communites, whereas the Girvan-Newman algorithm found 5.

In task 2 we calculate the **log-likelihood** based on a **Gaussian mixture model**. 
Now ill quickly cover what a **Gaussian Mixture Model** is. 
A mixture model is essentially used when we want a model to account for multiple different distributions. The mixture model is constructed using mixture components that each represents a distribution in the mixture model. A gaussian mixture model is a mixture model that is constructed using gaussian distributions as mixture components.  

When applying Gaussian Mixture Models, in can be done using the **Expectation Maximization algorithm**. Using this algorithm, we start with a random guess for what the clusters are going to be, and then proceed to improve iteratively by alternating two steps:

1. Expectation: Assign each datapoint to a cluster probabilistically, meaning, the distance to the clusters.
2. Maximization: Update the parameters for the clusters (weighted mean location and variance-covariance matrix) based on the points in the cluster (weighted by their probability assigned in the first set)

- Inductive and transductive classification
- Homophily
- Independent classification
- Label propagation
- Node classification with Markov networks

Okay so I will talk about node classification in graph data. First of what is the difference between **inductive** and **transductive classification**.  **Inductive** is commonly known as traditional supervised learning. Were we train a machine learning model on a labelled training dataset, then the model is used to predict the labels of a testing dataset, which have not been seen before.
**Transductive** differs because here all the data, both the trainig and test data is observed beforehand. Even when the labels of the test is not known, it can still be used to find patterns during training.

Another difference is that for **Inductive** models the graph used for training can be different, and the new nodes can be added to the graph. Whereas for **Transductive** models the graph is fixed, if changes occour the algorithm has to be re-run.

Another term used is **Homophily**, which is when a link between individuals (such as friendship or other social connection) is correlated with those individuals being similar in nature. For example, friends often tend to be similar in characteristics like age, social background and education level.
